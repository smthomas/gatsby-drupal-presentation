## Gatsby is a Static Site Generator

...but it is also much more than that.

Because it's built with React

`Gatsby != Static`

## Drupal is a CMS

and it's also a powerful data modeling tool.

It makes it easy to make that data available through an API

___

## GraphQL is the Glue

It makes it easy to pull data from your Drupal site

and process it with Gatsby

___

# Before We Get Started

Just a few simple warnings...

___

# I'm not a Gatsby Expert

___

# I'm also not a comedian

Or even close for that matter

___

# I try really hard at both

___

## Gatsby is great at pulling in data to make a fast website.

## Drupal is great exposing it's data through an API

# Gatsby works great with other content sources

___

# Wordpress

___

# Netlify CMS

___

# Contentful CMS

___

# Or from the filesystem

Hint: That's what I'm doing with this slideshow

___

It's built with Gatsby and uses markdown files for the slides.

P.S. I'm sorry I'm not a designer!

___

# But why do I need Gatsby?

Isn't my current CMS enough on it's own?

___

# Maybe...

But there is a difference in development philosophy that might make it more clear.

___

## Gatsby is built from the ground up to be fast

You have to work really hard to build a slow Gatsby site.

___

## Drupal (and other CMSs) are built with a lot of features

You have to work really hard to make them fast

Usually this is accomplished by adding multiple caching layers at different levels

Most of these caching layers are trying to make the sites as static is possible (which is what Gatsby is out of the box),
Therefore, all your really trying to do is make your CMS perform like a Static site.
